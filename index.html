                We scraped a large amount of community data on Twitter, starting from a <a

                and used it to see what communities we could find. <br />

            <h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
            <div class="paragraph-2column">
                <p>
                    The size and utility of networks has increased exponentially in the last few decades. Social media
                    as well as other internet applications have made analysis of the connections between nodes
                    (including people) a highly productive exercise when trying to predict commonality between them,
                    including political affiliation, geographic location, and interest in a celebrity, to name a few
                    examples.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Much like the size of the graphs in general has increased exponentially, so does the cost of finding
                    these communities. As a graph grows, its edges grow exponentially and it is difficult to use many
                    algorithms that would work at small scale to analyze large scale data. We used an algorithm known as
                    the Louvain Method to predict communities based on common edges between nodes in our dataset. After
                    we predicted the communities with the largest size, we told a story about what real community the
                    algorithm had detected based on manual analysis of community members.

                    <p>
                        We gathered data by scraping Twitter starting at our seed account, @DessaDarling. Starting with
                        Dessa's account, we scraped the first three thousand followers for each user, as well as the
                        first three thousand accounts following them. From this data, we built a list of users on both
                        lists for a given users (<b>mutual followers</b>). These <b>mutuals</b> would be the
                        relationship we would use to construct our graph.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For each mutual, we would check to see if we had already scraped their account and, if we had
                        not, we would add them to a queue of users to scrape. We woul then scrape each of the users in
                        the queue in order, leading to a depth-first-search approach to traversing the graph.<br>
                        <b>All in all, we ended up with about 140MB of data (~55MB compressed) to analyze. From there,
                            we
                            proceeded to our community detection.</b>

                    <h2>DETECTING COMMUNITIES</h2>
                    <p>
                        The Louvain Method we used to detech graph communities uses <b>modularity</b> to determine if a
                        set of nodes is a community. <b>Modularity</b> is the comparison between the expected number of
                        edges between a set of nodes and the actual number of edges detected. A group more internally
                        connected than the graph as a whole has a high <b>modularity</b>.
                    </p>

                    <h2>CONCLUSION</h2>
                    <p>
                        After utilizing the louvain algorithm to identify communities on the twitter dataset we have
                        identified 10 interesting communities. Characterizing these communities and analyzing their
                        commonalities we found two distinct features that connected the accounts in each community. The
                        first feature being the geographical location of the twitter accounts, for example community 10
                        consisted of accounts solely based in Essex county, in the United Kingdom. The second feature
                        was the interest and professions of the twitter accounts, for example community 2 consisted of
                        accounts of individuals in medical professions and PHD medical students. Throughout our analysis
                        we also identified communities that were connected based upon the merging of both geographical
                        location and interest. One distinct example can be found within community 5 which consisted of
                        accounts that were all based in the UK and all had a focus on scriptwriting, ranging from tv
                        shows to theatrical productions.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Overall these findings suggest that undetected communities exist within social media networks
                        and can be uncovered with high accuracy by the Louvain algorithm. It is important to carefully
                        test the performance of the louvain algorithm individually on every social media platform to
                        determine whether these communities can be extracted. More specifically, it is important to
                        utilize sampling and random testing to manually assess extracted communities that may contain
                        accounts that are not correlated. An example of this can be seen in community 7 where 4/10 user
                        accounts had unidentifiable similarities to the community of producers/rappers, showcasing a
                        possible case of low accuracy community detection. As previously stated, further research is
                        required to determine the Louvain algorithm’s applicability in the field of community detection
                        within a variety of social media networks that structure their accounts and networks
                        differently.

                    <h2>IMPLICATIONS</h2>
                    <p>
                        Looking to future research, it's essential to take our findings and processes and implement them
                        on various social networks to identify possible applicabilities.
                        Furthermore, it is recommended to make use of API access on social media networks productively,
                        as we learned throughout our research. Twitter’s API key gave us access to only scrape 1 account
                        or 1000 results per request (whichever is less), equating to 15 requests per 15 minutes per api
                        key. With 3 api keys, a minimum of 15 accounts per 15 minutes or up to 45 accounts per 15
                        minutes depending on a user’s followers/following. This limitation challenged our data gathering
                        capabilities with a database that houses millions of users. Through analysis we discovered that
                        by sampling only the top 3000 followers/following of each user, we were able to still extract
                        meaningful results with our mode. Therefore, analyzing a social network’s API capabilities and
                        identifying creative solutions to collect meaningful data.
                        Utilizing our findings it would be interesting to research the application of community
                        detection on advertisement recommendations. Specifically, through our identification of
                        community interests and locations using less sensitive data, social networks can allow
                        advertisers to target accounts accurately without the release of highly sensitive account data
                        that is currently utilized. This benefits the consumer/account owner by keeping their personal
                        data safe, while also giving advertisers similar advertisement turnover accuracy. This is
                        becoming particularly important in a world where more of our private data is shared on a daily
                        basis.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Furthermore, it would be interesting to apply the louvain algorithm’s community detection
                        capabilities in group and account recommendations on social media platforms. Currently, on many
                        platforms such as Instagram or facebook, account recommendations are based upon the people you
                        follow and their connections. With the uncovering of hidden communities of common interests,
                        platforms may be able to implement account recommendations based upon common interests among
                        individuals.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We have only surfaced the tip of the iceberg to identify communities within social media
                        platforms, it is now in the hands of the social media network giants and scientific community to
                        both further research and implement learnings in this space.
