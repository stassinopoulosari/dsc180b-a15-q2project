            <h2>SUMMARY</h2>
            <p id="hero-summary">
                We scraped a large amount of community data on Twitter, starting from a <a
                    href="https://twitter.com/DessaDarling" target="_blank">seed account</a>,
                and used it to see what communities we could find. <a href="#results">(Skip&nbsp;to&nbsp;results)</a>
            </p>
            <h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
            <div class="paragraph-2column">
                <p>
                    The size and utility of networks has increased exponentially in the last few decades. Social media
                    as well as other internet applications have made analysis of the connections between nodes
                    (including people) a highly productive exercise when trying to predict commonality between them,
                    including political affiliation, geographic location, and interest in a celebrity, to name a few
                    examples.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Much like the size of the graphs in general has increased exponentially, so does the cost of finding
                    these communities. As a graph grows, its edges grow exponentially and it is difficult to use many
                    algorithms that would work at small scale to analyze large scale data. We used an algorithm known as
                    the Louvain Method to predict communities based on common edges between nodes in our dataset. After
                    we predicted the communities with the largest size, we told a story about what real community the
                    algorithm had detected based on manual analysis of community members.

                    <h2>GATHERING DATA</h2>
                    <p>
                        We gathered data by scraping Twitter starting at our seed account, @DessaDarling. Starting with
                        Dessa's account, we scraped the first three thousand followers for each user, as well as the
                        first three thousand accounts following them. From this data, we built a list of users on both
                        lists for a given users (<b>mutual followers</b>). These <b>mutuals</b> would be the
                        relationship we would use to construct our graph.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For each mutual, we would check to see if we had already scraped their account and, if we had
                        not, we would add them to a queue of users to scrape. We woul then scrape each of the users in
                        the queue in order, leading to a depth-first-search approach to traversing the graph.<br>
                        <b>All in all, we ended up with about 140MB of data (~55MB compressed) to analyze. From there,
                            we
                            proceeded to our community detection.</b>

                    <h2>DETECTING COMMUNITIES</h2>
                    <p>
                        The Louvain Method we used to detech graph communities uses <b>modularity</b> to determine if a
                        set of nodes is a community. <b>Modularity</b> is the comparison between the expected number of
                        edges between a set of nodes and the actual number of edges detected. A group more internally
                        connected than the graph as a whole has a high <b>modularity</b>.
                    </p>
