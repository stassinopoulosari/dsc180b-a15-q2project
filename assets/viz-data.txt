Medical Professionals
This community centers around the medical professionals in the industry and education sector of the medical industry. Specifically, all medical accounts are in the cognitive sector of Psychology and Psychiatry You found mini clusters of PHD students. It is interesting that there is only one account that isn't a medical professional or educator which was the account “NaoTsuchiya” that was solely a student and youtube video maker about the cognitive phenomena of consciousness.

UK Screenplay Writers
This community contained individuals that were writers for either theater productions, television shows, or comedy shows. All the accounts were also based in the United Kingdom. It was interesting how there was really three sub communities in writing of theater, television and comedy. Lastly, there was also 2-3 accounts that were award winning writers which is an interesting sub community within writers.

A community of corporate leaders with little to no overlap otherwise. It’s interesting that despite being in very different fields, that they are part of the same community due to simply being leaders in their field.

Producers/Rappers
A music producer/rapper community, it was difficult to identify many of the accounts and their purpose, likely due to the informal nature of the community. Many accounts were missing their bios, and were operated more like personal accounts rather than a public-facing channel. It’s an interesting quirk of the community subculture.

Game/Comic Animators
This seems to be a community centered around tabletop games, comics, and other “geek” type hobbies. These include a huge variety of content producers in the scene such as designers, podcasters, and fanclubs. It’s interesting that despite there not exactly being a clear overlap in some of these hobbies, that we can still identify them as sharing an audience and being in the same community.

Essex, UK
A community centered geographically around Essex, a county in the UK. Interestingly, many of the top account handles seem to be police inspectors. That doesn’t necessarily mean that this is a police-centered community however, it could simply be that police inspectors tend to have a larger outreach, and that our usage of a node’s degree as the ranking causes them to show up higher.
